# AntiMicro-mrks-user-profiles

Press the green "Clone and download" then Download Zip.

I set up profiles using xbox 360 gamepad, I hope they will work fine with dualshocks and other models, certainly lower thumbstick dead zones if you use one of those.

For superior aiming it is recommended to disable the Enhance Pointer Precision in Windows options or in AntiMicro - Settings - Mouse.
